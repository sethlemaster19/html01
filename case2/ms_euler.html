            <h1>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h1>
                <img src="ms_euler.png" alt="" /> 

<p>The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, 
<strong>Leonhard Euler</strong> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, 
he studied under another giant of mathematics, <strong>Jean 
Bernoulli</strong>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics 
and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. 
Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, 
publishing over <em>800 different books and papers</em>. His 
influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well.</p>

<p>He is perhaps best known for his research into <img src="jtc_photo2.png" alt="" />
mathematical analysis. Euler's work, 
<cite>Introductio in analysin infinitorum (1748)</cite>, 
remained a standard textbook in the field for 
well over a century. For the princess of Anhalt-Dessau, 
he wrote 
<cite>Lettres &agrave; une princesse d'Allemagne (1768-1772)</cite>, 
giving a clear non-technical outline of the main 
physical theories of the time.</p>

<p>One can hardly write a mathematical equation without 
copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such 
as <var>e</var> and &#960;, were introduced 
in Euler's writings. Leonhard Euler died in 1783, 
leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and 
certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.</p>

            <h1>The Most Beautiful Equation in Math?</h1>

            <p>Perhaps the most elegant equation in the history of math is:</p>

            <code>cos(x)+isin(x)=e<sup>xi</code></sup> 

            <p>which demonstrates the relationship between algebra, 
            complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this 
            equation, it's easy to derive the identity:</p>

            <code>e<sup>&#960i</sup>+1=0</code>

            <p>which relates the fundamental constants: 
            <var>0</var>, <var>1</var>, &#960, <var>e</var>, and <var>i</var> in a single beautiful and 
            elegant statement. A poll of readers 
            conducted by The <cite>Mathematical Intelligencer</cite>
            magazine named Euler's Identity as the 
            most beautiful theorem in the history of 
            mathematics.</p>
